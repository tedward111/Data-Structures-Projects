My program is really two separate programs: one program allows users to play the game "Bagels" with their choice of number of digits, whether zero is to be included as an option, and difficulty level.  The difficulty level affects the number of guesses they will get.  The other other program has the computer guess a 3 digit number within 18 turns in "Bagels", which my computer manages to successfully do about 85% of the time.

I actually have ended up not really using classes.  The functions I have used include a function that returns a Pico Fermi string, or, alternatively, returns the result of the game if the game is over.  I also wrote a function to randomly generate a number to guess.  Additionally, I wrote three separate functions to help the computer to do as best as possible at "Bagels."  It seemed easiest for me to not use classes.  Looking back on it, it may have been more organized with classes, but it seems to work quite well anyway.

As mentioned earlier, the bagelscomputer program successfully guesses the answer within 18 turns about 85% of the time.  The times that I couldn't account for very well were in situations in which the randomly generated number contains numbers that are all equally spread out, like 369, 825, or 471.
